`Once upon a time there were some intrepid explorers who wandered into the Amazon. They found some amazing things! Piranhas are more ${userMood} during the day, so make sure you cross the noun at night. Piranhas are attracted to fresh liquid and will most likely take a bite out of your body part if you verb. Whatever you do, if you have an open ${userName} try and find another way to get back to place. Good luck!`
